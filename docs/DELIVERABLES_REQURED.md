# Deliverables

On MarkUs for the "week3project" assignment (to appear after labs on Monday),
your team will submit the URL to a public GitHub repo. It can be a new repo or
you can start from the repo forked from the lab activity and just delete any
files that aren’t relevant. Your repo needs to contain:

## `README.md` File

- Must include:
    - [x] A description of the problem domain your team is tentatively wanting
    to focus on in the project. (e.g., trivia, finance, real estate, etc…)
    - [x] A brief, high-level description of what kind of application your team
    is thinking of developing.
        - This is mostly just so we can give you some initial feedback on
        whether your team might want to reconsider your project direction.
    - [x] A link to the documentation for an API your team can use related to
    the domain.
    - [x] A screenshot of using a tool to try out the API (like
    https://www.postman.com/ or https://hoppscotch.io/)
    - [x] Example output of running your Java code (see below).
    - [x] A list of any technical problems blocking progress (if any)
        - please don't hesitate to ask such questions on Piazza too of course.

## Java Code

- Must include:
    - [x] A minimal example of calling the API from Java.
    - [x] The output of the program should indicate the result of the request.

## Evaluation

- Your team is being assessed on:
    - Whether you have all required elements listed above.
    - The overall presentation of the information.
- Your team is not being assessed on:
    - Whether you have gotten sample calls to the API fully working. Depending
    on the API, this might be more involved, so we just need to see a clear
    attempt by your team. Still include your code and screenshots of what you
    have attempted so far to earn credit.
